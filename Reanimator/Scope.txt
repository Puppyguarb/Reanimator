[x]Objective 1: Find a way to give the player troops after battle. Ideally, that number should equal the amount killed.
	[X]> Find a way to see debug messages.
	[x]> Figure out what handles troop management, and probably prisoner management. Likely a battle end class. 	BattleEndLogic seems like a good start.
	[x]> Figure out a way to add the troops. Probably by adding them as prisoners.
		Here's what I'm thinking, everytime an agent dies, we check that they're not a horse, and later that they're 		not one of the special undead. We add them to a death counter, which we will use at the end of the battle.

		For the counter we need a global variable that's set to 0 when a battle begins, and is used after to give 		prisoners.
[x]Objective 2: Create a custom troop, call it Undead or something. The kills should give the player these.
[x]Objective 3: When the custom troop dies, they shouldn't be given back to the player.
[x]Objective 4: When the player kills an entire army with zero prisoners, we should force the game to open the troop transfer screen anyway.
[x]Objective: Make undead have no upkeep.

[/]Objective: Make undead not require food.
	> Need a way to track how many undead are in the party, but not run it every frame.
	  Ideally, this will be achieved by checking whenever the game is loaded, and whenever the player alters their party.


[x]Objective: Add more undead. Tier matters for deaths. Archers count as one tier less (minimum of one)
[x]Objective: When the player does not participate in a battle, they should still get undead from enemies their troops killed.

[x]Objective: When a player simulates a battle between them and an enemy, but with allied parties, they should not get troops from their allies' kills.

Objective: On battle start, clear the stored troop arrays in case the player lost a battle earlier and has cached undead.
Objective: Add a way for the player to kill their prisoners? If they have too many and can't get any more undead.

Objective: Find a way to check if a character is undead, and if it's by comparing race ids, find a way to keep compatibility.
Objective: Fix translations
