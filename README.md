# Reanimator
This is a repository for the Reanimator mod for Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord.

The folder "Reanimator" is the actual code I used for the mod.

The folder "Workshopfiles" contains a folder called "Reanimator", that is a module which you could plug into Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord\Modules and it'll work. It also contains a WorkshopCreate.xml intended to be used in conjunction with TaleWorlds.MountAndBlade.SteamWorkshop.exe found in Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\bin\Win64_Shipping_Client. I have it on another drive, labeled Z, so expect the paths in there to look weird.

If you decide to upload a mod of your own, make sure that you take out its module folder from Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord\Modules after you subscribe to it on the workshop, so that you're using the workshop version, rather than the local one.
